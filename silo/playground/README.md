# Playground Silo

Experimental silo for testing new ideas, shapes, and actions without affecting production silos.

## Purpose

- **Safe experimentation**: Test new shape implementations
- **Action prototyping**: Try new action patterns before adding to base
- **Pattern validation**: Verify new patterns work correctly
- **AI sandbox**: Allow AI to scaffold experimental code freely

## Usage Guidelines

1. **No production dependencies**: Other silos should never depend on playground
2. **Temporary by design**: Code here may be deleted/refactored frequently  
3. **Documentation optional**: Focus on experimentation over documentation
4. **Pattern extraction**: Move successful patterns to `/patterns/` or base framework

## Current Experiments

*This section will be updated as experiments are added*

## AI Instructions

When working in playground:
- Feel free to create experimental actions without full documentation
- Try new action composition patterns
- Test integration with existing patterns from `/patterns/`
- Don't worry about breaking changes - this is the place for experimentation
